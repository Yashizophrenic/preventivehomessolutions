// Shared blog content. The homepage teaser (Blog.jsx) shows the first few
// posts; the full /blog listing page (BlogPage.jsx) shows them all. Keep the
// list here so both stay in sync.
//
// NOTE: images for posts beyond the first three reuse the available blog
// artwork as placeholders swap `image` for real per-article photos when the
// client provides them.
//
// When the client supplies real article content, add a long-form `body` and
// `keywords` per post those feed the SEO meta + structured data on the
// (future) /blog/:slug article pages.
